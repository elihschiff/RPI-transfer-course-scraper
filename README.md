# RPI-transfer-course-scraper

Due to how RPI keeps track of courses you can transfer in, you have to search by school and then see which classes they offer that RPI accepts for transfer credit.

This program allows you to search by specific course (EX: "WRIT 1110"), instead of by specific school, and see every school that offers a replacement transfer course that RPI accepts.
